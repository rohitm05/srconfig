	<h1 ><b>TATA PRASHIKSHAN</b></h1>
	<p ><big>Shavak Nanavati Technical Institute (SNTI), the erstwhile<i> "Jamshedpur Technical Institute" (JTI)</i> was established in 1921, with the inspiration of the Founder<i> "Let the Indians learn to do things by themselves"</i>. Today SNTI, an integral part of the Human Resource Division of Tata Steel, has rendered commendable service in nation building through the development of technical manpower, not only for Tata Steel but, for many other Tata organisations, private and public sector Steel Plants and manufacturing industries. 
<br>
	<i>"Career at Tata Steel gives you the opportunity to be part of an organisation, which has always been ahead of the times: a combination of blistering pace of growth and unflinching values. A career with us is more than just a job; it is an opportunity to join a company, which has woven itself into the social fabric around it."</i></big><br><h3>Products and Services</h3><br>

ii. Post employment training (Day) : Training for those who are already working in Tata Steel and are nominated by respective departments for knowledge and skill development in their respective work areas. Such training programmes are planned annually, based on requirement of the respective departments. The employees are withdrawn from the departments for this purpose. 'Thrust Area' programmes are also conducted with a focus on specific topics or requirement as indicated by the departments. Some growth related competency development programmes are also organized under this category. <br>
iii. Post employment training (Evening) : imparted to the supervisory/ associate category of employees basically for their competency development and qualification enhancement. Such programmes are conducted off-duty hours on original and repeat basis at the employees' own time.<br>

* Vocational training - for Engg. Students, through guided project work,<br>
* Industrial/ Plant visits - for Technical Institutes and other industries,<br>
* Customised programmes for other organizations. <br>
<h3>Operations and Facilities</h3><br>

<li>Training Shop: This campus, located inside the Works, constitutes class rooms and the laboratories in various disciplines viz. Mechanical assembly, Fluid power, Automobile, Welding, Digital and analog drives, Process control and Instrumentation, Electrical, Electronics and Communication, Refractories and Information technology. All the laboratories are equipped with facilities to deliver demonstration and hands-on training for development of entire range of skills required to run the steel plant including trade testing facilities. The 'Advance Training Facility' building, with all the state-of-the-art training facilities, came up in 1989 in collaboration with the then 'Hoogovens Technical Services' in Netherlands for upgrading the existing technical training systems here.</li> <br>
<li> Crane Training Centre (CTC) : This is also situated inside the Works at a separated location and is specifically dedicated for training on crane operations and rigging.</li><br>
